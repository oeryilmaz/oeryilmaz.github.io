title: "The Impacts of Health Shocks on Household Labor Supply and Domestic Production (with Giovanni Di Meo)"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Publication3.md
excerpt: "This paper investigates the impact of severe health shocks on labor supply decisions and domestic production within German households. We draw from the German SocioEconomic Panel (SOEP), focusing on individuals aged 25 to 50 at the time of their first observed health shock. After the health shock, we find that affected individuals suffer a persistent loss in annual gross labor income of around 3,300 Euros. This effect results mostly from adjustments at the extensive margin, with labor market participation declining by about 13%. We observe a reduction in full-time employment, but no significant effect on part-time employment. At the household level, a combination of public transfers and added worker effect effectively compensates for the income loss. Finally, individuals experiencing a health shock, in particular women, spend more time on domestic production."
