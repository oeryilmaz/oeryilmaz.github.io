excerpt: "The death of a spouse is one of the most severe financial shocks that an individual can face during his or her life cycle. Understanding the degree of consumption smoothing against the financial risks associated with spousal death is a key issue in the design of old-age support policies. In this paper, we examine the impact of a spousal mortality shock on survivors' consumption in the U.S., combining data from the Health and Retirement Study with data from the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey and using an event-study design. We find evidence that survivors' consumption falls sharply following the spousal mortality shock, while consumption per adult equivalent increases on average.  We show that an incomplete markets life-cycle model with two spouses and a stylized but careful representation of the US social security system can rationalize these findings. These results suggest that the death of a spouse is not a major cause of old-age poverty and provide support for the existing system of survivor benefits."
