## Tools and Misc
Here is a collection of resources I have found really useful in my research and data-related work in general. I am sharing them here in case others find them helpful, too. It goes without saying that all credit goes to the developers of the respective tools. 

### Packages for R

- [dtplyr](https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/): This is basically a data.table backend for dplyr, which means you get the speed of data.table with the more user-friendly syntax of dplyr.
- [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/): Build interactive web apps straight from R.
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/): For creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.
- [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/): A project-local package management system, similar to Python's virtualenv. It keeps your project's R dependencies isolated and reproducible, which is crucial to reproduce results.

### Color Palettes for R
