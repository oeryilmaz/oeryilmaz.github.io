## Tools and Misc
Here is a collection of resources I have found really useful in my research and data-related work in general. I am sharing them here in case others find them helpful, too. It goes without saying that all credit goes to the developers of the respective tools. 

### Packages for R
This is basically a data.table backend for dplyr, which means you get the speed of data.table with the more user-friendly syntax of dplyr.
- [dtplyr](https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/)

### Color Palettes for R
