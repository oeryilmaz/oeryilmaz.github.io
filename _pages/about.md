About me
------

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the Center of Economic Research at [ETH Zurich](https://irme.ethz.ch/), with a focus on population aging and its interactions with labor supply, retirement savings, and health shocks. My research spans the U.S. and German institutional settings, although my primary focus is on the Swiss retirement system. Passionate about uncovering insights that can inform and improve pension policies and labor practices, my aim is to contribute by employing causal inference and other econometric tools.

Before joining ETH Zurich, I worked for the [Center for Evaluation and Development (C4ED)](https://c4ed.org/) as a Junior Research Manager, and the [Chair of Econometrics](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/about/faculty-members/prof-dr-froelich/) at the University of Mannheim as a research assistant. During this time, I gathered experience in policy evaluation methods – particularly randomized control trials and field experiments - survey design in low-income countries, and coding. I have also contributed to projects at the [DIW Berlin](https://www.diw.de/en) as a research assistant, and as a pre-doctoral researcher at the [Chair of Human Resources](https://www.wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de/en/departments/mm/professuren/professur-friebel/team/prof-guido-friebel-phd.html) at the Goethe University Frankfurt. 

I am currently part of the team organizing the workshop [The Microeconomics of Aging]([The Microeconomics of Aging: Savings, Pensions, Long-​Term Care, Health and Disabilities](https://riskcenter.ethz.ch/events/workshops.html)https://riskcenter.ethz.ch/events/workshops.html), where I will also be presenting joint work with Giovanni di Meo.
