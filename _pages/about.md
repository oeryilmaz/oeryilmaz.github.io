About me
------

I am a PhD Candidate at the Center of Economic Research at ETH Zurich, specializing in Economics with a focus on population aging and its interactions with labor supply, retirement savings, and health shocks. My research spans the U.S. and German institutional settings, although my primary focus is on the Swiss retirement system. Passionate about uncovering insights that can inform and improve pension policies and labor practices, my aim is to contribute by employing causal inference and other econometric tools.

Before joining ETH Zurich, I worked for the Center for Evaluation and Development as a Junior Research Manager, and for the Chair of Econometrics at the University of Mannheim as a Research Assistant. During this time, I gathered experience in policy evaluation methods â€“ particularly randomized control trials and field experiments - and survey design in low-income countries. I have also contributed to a project at the DIW Berlin as a Research Assistant, where we investigated the impacts of climate change on Mongolian nomadic families.
