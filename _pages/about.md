About me
------

I am an economist with a strong focus on econometrics, causal inference, and the application of advanced quantitative methods to real-world economic problems. As I complete my Ph.D. in Economics at ETH Zurich, following a Masterâ€™s in Economics at the University of Mannheim, I am seeking opportunities to apply my expertise in roles such as economist, data scientist, or quantitative researcher. My adaptability and passion for solving complex problems make me well-suited for industries where data-driven decision-making is essential for strategic growth.

My core strength lies in econometrics and the application of causal inference tools and machine learning methods to complex business and economic questions. My research portfolio demonstrates my ability to tackle diverse topics with real-world implications, from analyzing labor market dynamics to evaluating the economic impacts of health and environmental shocks. I excel in handling large-scale datasets and implementing robust methodological approaches to uncover causal relationships that inform decision-making.

Technically proficient in R, Python, SQL, and Stata, I have extensive experience in developing data pipelines, conducting sophisticated statistical analyses, and translating complex findings into actionable insights. My collaborative projects with major institutions, Publica, the pension fund of the Swiss Federation, and UNICEF, showcase my ability to bridge rigorous academic research with practical applications in both public and private sectors.

I have a proven track record of project management and stakeholder collaboration, having co-managed multiple research projects and partnerships with industry leaders. My skills in data visualization and communication allow me to present complex findings through clear, insightful visualizations and reports for diverse stakeholders, including executive-level decision-makers.
