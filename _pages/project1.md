This app visualizes changes in the OECD's consumer confidence indicator (CCI) for a selected set of countries. The goal of the CCI is to measure whether consumers are optimistic or pessimistic about the future state of the economy and their personal economic welfare. Values above 100 signal optimistic attitudes. The underlying idea of the indicator is that optimistic consumers are more likely to consume big-ticket items, such as real estate, and less likely to save. Note that the CCI provides qualitative rather than quantitative information. That is, the size or amplitude of changes cannot be interpreted, only its position relative to the 100-value mark. All data are from the OECD covering 01-2019 to 09-2024 or earlier within 2024, or the latest available data for each country.
